I was in charge of the presentation on first part like below.
"Do you know “Cool japan”? This word expresses Japan’s charm that the other countries regard as cool or attractive. Mainly, the word is used for Japanese foods, animation or culture." 
When I talked about Cool Japan, I was conscious of the fact that there are various types of Cool Japan and that I would like to give an overview.
I think I was able to contribute to the team in that regard.
